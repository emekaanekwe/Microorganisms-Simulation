# Primordial-Soup-Simulation:
## Creating hypothetical micro-organisms that simulate, in the most rudimentary sense, the earliest life on Earth.

### Project Goals

I am interested in creating a simple simulation of the evolution by natural selection of very basic organisms (such as cyanobacteria.) In a simplistic view of natural selection, organisms are the vehicles of genetic selection  <reference>. , and there are a variety of machine learning models and algorithms that attempt at capturing such processes <ref>. 

My project takes a slightly different (and perhaps too ambitious) approach to evolutionary algorithms in machine learning by flipping the concept of natural selection on its head: rather than the agents being of the nexus of learning (i.e., selection), learning is conducted by the enviroment and grid where the agents reside.

After some research, I considered how I wanted to structure this project.
